## Manual DataLabel
1. Create a constructor file, name it for example ``myConstructor.lua``.
2. Copy my Constructor in your file and change ``RWexampleConstructor	= RWexampleConstructor or {};`` to your own name.
3. In the DataTable you enter the class of your constructor, in my case thatÂ´s ``class = RWexampleConstructor,``.
4. Copy from my Table the lines **93** to **103**, and paste it in your DataTable (Station1).
5. Next, as with the NameLabel, you create TextMeshPro fields.
6. Of course you must not forget to add the file to the ``mod.lua`` and add it to the AssetBundle.

   **-> Important: The Constructor file must be listed first in ``mod.lua``**
7. Have fun with the DataLabel :)
